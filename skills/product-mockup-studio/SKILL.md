# Product Mockup Studio

## Freshness
Last updated: `2026-09-29`.

If the current date is more than 7 days after the last updated date, reinstall this skill from skills.sh or ClawHub before relying on endpoints, schemas, setup steps, or examples.

## What This Tool Does
AI product photography and product video generator for e-commerce brands, marketers, and agencies. Upload one to five ordinary photos of your product and Product Mockup Studio turns them into polished studio hero shots, lifestyle scenes, flat lays, in-hand shots, packaging mockups, and clean marketplace-ready e-commerce images, with no photoshoot required. Lock in the details that matter using brand constraints for exact label text, brand colors, and must-keep product features, then fix any render with a plain-language revision. Once a still is approved, animate it into a 4, 6, or 8 second MP4 product clip with a slow push-in, orbit, turntable, light sweep, or floating motion in landscape 16:9 or vertical 9:16 for Shopify, Amazon, Etsy, Instagram Reels, TikTok, and YouTube Shorts. Powered by ElevenLabs Image & Video, including Google Veo 3.1 for motion, with Nano Banana available as an alternate still-image engine. Every PNG and MP4 is saved to your AgentPMT File Manager. Requires your own ElevenLabs API key.

## Product Instructions
### Product Mockup Studio

Create a polished product still from reference photos, refine an approved still, or animate it into a short product clip. Inputs and outputs use AgentPMT File Manager IDs.

#### Recommended workflow

1. Upload one to five clear product images to File Manager.
2. Call `create_product_mockup` in `draft` mode.
3. Poll `get_mockup_job` until the image is `completed` or `failed`.
4. Visually review logos, text, dimensions, colors, and product details. Generated media always requires review.
5. Use `refine_product_mockup` for a focused revision, or create a fresh render with `image_provider: "nano_banana"` to compare providers.
6. Animate only an approved still, then poll the new video job.

The tool creates the output filename and uses the platform's fixed seven-day File Manager retention. There are no filename or expiration inputs.

#### Image provider behavior

- `auto` prefers ElevenLabs. With no mask and no more than four references, it falls back to Nano Banana only when ElevenLabs definitively rejects the submission for credentials, access, quota, rate limit, or invalid parameters. It does not retry or fall back after an ambiguous network failure because that could duplicate a paid generation.
- `elevenlabs` forces ElevenLabs image generation.
- `nano_banana` forces the approved centralized Google image connection.
- A successfully generated but visually weak image does not switch providers automatically. Review it, then explicitly refine it or create a new render with the other provider.
- Masked generation uses the ElevenLabs final route; masks are not accepted with `nano_banana`.

#### Actions

##### `create_product_mockup`

Required: `product_file_ids`, `scene_prompt`.

Useful optional fields: `product_description`, `mockup_style`, `camera_view`, `style_reference_file_ids`, `image_provider`, `render_mode` (`draft|final`), `aspect_ratio`, `mask_file_id`, and `brand_constraints`.

```json
{"action":"create_product_mockup","product_file_ids":["file_id"],"scene_prompt":"Premium studio hero shot on warm stone with soft side lighting","render_mode":"draft","image_provider":"auto"}
```

##### `refine_product_mockup`

Required: `source_task_id`, `instruction`. The source must be a completed image job from this tool in the same budget.

```json
{"action":"refine_product_mockup","source_task_id":"task_id","instruction":"Keep the package unchanged; make the background pale gray and soften the contact shadow","render_mode":"final"}
```

##### `animate_product_mockup`

Provide exactly one of `source_task_id` or `source_file_id`. Video uses ElevenLabs only. Optional controls include `motion_preset`, `motion_prompt`, `duration_seconds` (`4|6|8`), `aspect_ratio` (`16:9|9:16`), `resolution`, `render_mode` (`preview|final`), `generate_audio`, `end_frame_file_id`, `negative_prompt`, and `seed`.

When `aspect_ratio` is omitted it follows the still's orientation: a portrait still animates as `9:16` and every other still as `16:9`. The chosen value is returned as `aspect_ratio` on the create response.

A still that does not already match the video aspect is center-cropped before it is sent, because the video model otherwise pads the mismatch with black bars. The response reports the crop as `start_frame_adjustment`. To control the framing yourself, refine the still to the video aspect first, then animate that task.

```json
{"action":"animate_product_mockup","source_task_id":"completed_image_task_id","motion_preset":"slow_push_in","duration_seconds":6,"render_mode":"preview"}
```

##### `get_mockup_job`

Required: `task_id`. Polling an ElevenLabs job also imports a completed provider output into File Manager. Wait at least 2 seconds between image polls and 10 seconds between video polls. Once the task is completed, later polls return the stored output rather than importing it again.

```json
{"action":"get_mockup_job","task_id":"task_id"}
```

##### `list_mockup_jobs`

Lists jobs in the current budget. Optional: `media_kind`, `status`, `page_size`, and `cursor`.

#### Output

Creation actions return a `task_id` immediately. Completed jobs contain an `outputs` array with the provider, model, media kind, and a managed File Manager object containing `file_id`, generated `filename`, `content_type`, size, and signed preview URL. Still images are normalized to PNG; videos are MP4.

## Live Schema And Examples
Use the compact schema above for ordinary calls. Before a new production integration, or whenever parameters, enum values, nested objects, outputs, or examples are unclear, fetch live details first.

- Exact schema: call `agentpmt-tool-search-and-execution` with `action: "get_schema"`, and `tool_id: "product-mockup-studio"`.
- Detailed examples: call `agentpmt-tool-search-and-execution` with `action: "get_instructions"` and `tool_id: "product-mockup-studio"`, or call this product with `action: "get_instructions"` when the product tool is already selected.
- Treat returned live schema and instructions as more specific than this generated summary.

## Response Handling
- Treat the returned JSON as the source of truth for this tool call.
- If the response includes warnings or correction targets, apply them before retrying.
- If the response includes a `passed` or success-style boolean, use it as the workflow gate.
- If validation fails or the response shape is unclear, call `get_schema` or `get_instructions` before retrying.
- If `animate_product_mockup` fails, preserve the request parameters and retry only after fixing schema, auth, or payment errors.

## Security
- Do not place account secrets, wallet private keys, mnemonics, signatures, or payment headers in prompts or logs.
- Keep tool inputs scoped to the minimum content needed for the task.
- Use the setup skills for credential handling; this product skill only defines product-specific behavior.
